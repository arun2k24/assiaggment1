 Trekking to the Chembra peak is one of the risky tourist endeavours. Chembra peak is the highest peak in Wayanad at 2100m. above mean sea level. It is14 kms. west of Kalpetta. Trekking to the top of this peak takes almost a day.
 Tourists can also stay one or two days at the top of the peak in temporary camps. District Tourism Promotion Council provides guides, sleeping bags, canvass huts trekking implements on hire charges to the tourists.
The scenic beauty of Wayanad which is visible from the top of Chembra is very challenging and thrilling.
The blue eyed water in the lake at the top of the hill never dries up even in the peak of summer.
All along the steep and slippery way to the top of the hill, the whispering of the flowing spring which sprouts from the top of the hill accompanies the tourist. 
 If he is fortunate enough, on his way he may come across a passing wild beast, may be a leopard who may instantly hide behind the bushes. Camping in the night with camp fire and sleeping bags at the top of the peak in shivering cold is everlasting experience 
 The deep rock caves formed among the thick blocks of rocks at the northern top end of the Brahmagiri is the abode of various birds and wild beasts.
To go to 'Pakshipathalam' special permission has to be obtained from forest department.  DTPC (District Tourism Promotion Council) arranges vehicle, guides, camping apparatus etc. to the tourists on hire charges.
